            <i>"The Jigsaw Factory was a landmark in Australian design history, resulting from the collaboration between Bruce Weatherhead and Alex Stitt in 1971. While primarily aimed at children, the Jigsaw Factory was ahead of its time, especially in terms of introducing complex political and environmental ideas through fun, educational and interactive design.
<br><br>
Inspired by this spirit, Save Spaceship Earth is an exhibition curated by RMIT Master of Communication Design students in collaboration with the RMIT Design Archives to explore our relationships with the environment through a series of sensorial, interactive and participatory experiences.
<br><br>
We often feel detached from environmental issues that seem grand and impossibly complex when going about our daily lives. In Save Spaceship Earth, we'd like to invite you to appreciate the beauty of our world and explore a more personal and intimate relationship with our fragile space ship. By reflecting on the past and speculating about the future, we can create small changes in the present that will make a big difference in our collective future."

It was xyxy's honor to work in these amazing teams because of this opportunity. The first team she worked with was the pilots team<s>, which mainly for concept the overal ideas</s>. xyxy helped all the teams for installations for directions and plans. Another team she mainly worked with was the table team,
and that is the most comfortable team she had. Since she came up the concept and found out the right inspirations, her team members helped with each other
to finish all the things in a short time and made them look great. <s>This experience of working in teams brought xyxy
confidence of doing teamwork in the future, also about
exhibition design itself</s>.<br><br>
This process shows the possibilities to design with the concepts. <s>It is a good example to prove that the concept is not always fluffy and useless, and it will continue encouraging her doing design in that direction</s>.
