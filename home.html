          <small><span style="color: rgb(140, 138, 138); font-size: 0.5rem;">2018 <br>Research Project, RMIT<br><br>Starting from the question "how might we visually communicate the sensory experience of travel",
xyxy went through a long way to find her home. More and more people now begin to find out that home, the
cultural concept, means much more than we thought. To understand home in the new cultural background,
new explorations are needed. Inspired by <a href="http://www.ingooffermanns.com/en">Ingo Offermanns<a>, communication design is "a cultural
technique for the knowledge-based society, and for capitalism," combined with the requirement that xyxy
gave to herself two years ago, this project was designed to explore how communication design can help
with communicating the cultural concepts and help with self-developing. <br><br>Communication design helps xyxy to get out of her little world, into this wild space.
At the same time, it also helps her to get deeper into herself.<br> <br>This project explored the connections between communication design and self-developing, and that
is important for her to keep being passionate in this field without losing herself. This project will not
stop at this stage; it will go further into many more stages of xyxy's life.
